<!-- Sync Impact Report -->
<!-- Version change: N/A â†’ 1.0.0 -->
<!-- Added sections: All core sections -->
<!-- Templates requiring updates: N/A (initial creation) -->
<!-- Follow-up TODOs: None -->

**Version:** 1.0.0  
**Ratified:** 2025-09-28  
**Last Amended:** 2025-09-28

## Core Principles

### User-Centric Design
All CLI interactions MUST prioritize user experience through intuitive commands, clear feedback, and comprehensive help documentation. Commands MUST follow consistent patterns and provide meaningful error messages with actionable guidance.

**Rationale:** Hardware specification workflows are complex and error-prone. Users need clear, predictable interfaces that reduce cognitive load and prevent costly mistakes in specification development.

### Specification Integrity
The tool MUST maintain data integrity throughout the specification lifecycle, ensuring that hardware specifications remain accurate, traceable, and verifiable from initial concept through manufacturing.

**Rationale:** Hardware specifications directly impact manufacturing costs, timelines, and product quality. Any corruption or loss of specification data can result in significant financial and reputational damage.

### Modular Architecture
The CLI MUST be built with modular, composable components that can be extended, tested, and maintained independently. Each module MUST have clear interfaces and minimal dependencies.

**Rationale:** Hardware specification tools need to evolve with changing requirements and integrate with diverse toolchains. Modular design enables rapid adaptation and reduces maintenance burden.

### Performance and Scalability
The tool MUST handle large specification files efficiently and provide responsive feedback even when processing complex hardware designs with thousands of components.

**Rationale:** Modern hardware specifications can contain massive BOMs and complex dependency graphs. Users cannot wait for slow operations when iterating on designs.

### Cross-Platform Compatibility
The CLI MUST function consistently across Windows, macOS, and Linux environments with identical behavior and feature parity.

**Rationale:** Hardware development teams use diverse operating systems. Inconsistent behavior across platforms creates friction and reduces adoption.

## Development Standards

### Code Quality
- All code MUST pass static analysis and linting checks
- Test coverage MUST meet minimum thresholds (80% for core functionality)
- Documentation MUST be generated for all public APIs
- Error handling MUST be comprehensive and user-friendly

### CLI Design
- Commands MUST follow consistent naming conventions (verb-noun pattern)
- Help text MUST be comprehensive and include examples
- Output MUST be machine-parseable when appropriate (JSON, YAML)
- Interactive prompts MUST provide clear guidance and validation

### Performance
- Command execution MUST complete within reasonable timeouts
- Memory usage MUST be optimized for large specification files
- Network operations MUST include retry logic and timeout handling
- File I/O MUST be efficient and handle large datasets

## Governance

### Amendment Procedure
1. Proposed amendments MUST be submitted as pull requests
2. Changes require review by at least two maintainers
3. Breaking changes require community discussion period (minimum 7 days)
4. All amendments MUST be documented with rationale

### Versioning Policy
- Follow semantic versioning (MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH)
- MAJOR: Breaking changes to CLI interface or core functionality
- MINOR: New features that maintain backward compatibility
- PATCH: Bug fixes and non-breaking improvements

### Compliance Review
- Quarterly review of adherence to principles
- Annual assessment of principle effectiveness
- Continuous monitoring of user feedback and pain points

## Enforcement

### Development Workflow
- All changes MUST be reviewed against this constitution
- Automated checks MUST validate compliance where possible
- Manual review required for principle interpretation

### Documentation Requirements
- README MUST include installation and quick start guide
- API documentation MUST be current and comprehensive
- Changelog MUST detail all user-facing changes
